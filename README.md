27476 - OOP

This repository contains my solutions for object oriented programming exercises for course OOP . Each exercise demonstrates key Java concepts including loops, conditionals, arrays, strings, object-oriented programming, and user input handling.

All exercises are implemented in separate Java files for clarity. The code is structured, commented, and ready to compile and run using standard Java tools.
